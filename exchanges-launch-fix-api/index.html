<h2 id="exchanges-launch-fix-api">Exchanges Launch FIX API</h2>
<p>Several exchanges with <a href="https://www.fintechee.com/features/fix-api/">FIX API</a>, the multi-asset class trading platforms, announced recently that they launched and traded the anonymous interbank FX Swaps order book with streaming quotes.</p>
<p>The trade, conducted with the exchanges&rsquo; central counterparty partner Standard Chartered Bank, represents a landmark in this $3.2 T/day* market.</p>
<p>In addition to the central counterparty option, bilateral trading for short tenors is also available. Trading in the one-week tenor – the most liquid part of the market which accounts for around 65% of transacted volume – is free on the Exchanges&rsquo; platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exchanges&rsquo; FX Swaps are a low-cost electronic option for our customers seeking help with hedging and risk management. The market has been asking for an electronic alternative to existing flows for some time and Exchanges are excited to be leading the way. With this important addition, Exchanges&rsquo; FX offering now exclusively brings its central counterparty model to the FX market&rsquo;s most important products – spot, swaps and CFDs,&rdquo; said the head marketers of Exchanges.</p>
<p>The exchanges&rsquo; platforms offer streaming liquidity on a number of major tenors in addition to a central limit order book, with access via GUI or FIX API. Credit is dynamically managed and updated in real time using <a href="https://www.fintechee.com/features/fix-api/">FIX engine</a>. Post-trade details are available from a variety of middleware vendors or direct via <a href="https://www.fintechee.com/features/fix-api/">FIX API</a> STP.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The FX Swaps market has been underserved for many years. With today&rsquo;s launch, Exchanges are giving all market participants the ability to interact in the same manner that they have demanded in other FX products. Traders now have a way to manage their information leakage associated with their swap pricing and trading, and no longer have to rely on old tools and workflows,&rdquo; added some journalist. &ldquo;Having been trading swaps on the buy side for more than 20 years, I know first-hand how important this evolution in Swaps trading is. The wait is finally over for traders on the exchanges&rsquo; platforms for FX Swaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These exchanges also announced that it set a new record (single-counted) in March of $456 million, as well as a new single-day record volume last month in FX CFDs when in excess of $800 million traded.</p>
